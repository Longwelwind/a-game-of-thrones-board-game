## Documentation

This repository contains two projects, in two separate folders:

* `agot-bg-game-server`: The game client and the game server which implements the logic of the game as well as the UI. It's in Typescript, React, Bootstrap and some other technologies.
* `agot-bg-website`: The website where users can register, create games and join them. It's in Python and Django.

The documentation at the moment is pretty scarce. Improving it is planned.
