/**
 * A lot of Wildling Cards have the same logic where the lowest bidder
 * must do something, and then all the other houses, in turn order, do a slightly different thing.
 *
 * This class helps implement these kind of Wildling Cards by extracting the
 * "in turn order, [action]" part of the logic, and let child classes implement
 * the "[action]".
 *
 * In practice, the child classes will implement the two abstract methods.
 * These two methods must make sure that, at some point, `onExecuteFinish` is called
 * so that the execution of the card can proceed.
