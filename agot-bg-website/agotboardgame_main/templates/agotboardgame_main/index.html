                <p>
                    At the moment, the focus is to finish implementing the base game and polish the existing features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final goal is to implement all the release gameplay of the extensions (Feast for Crows, Dance
                    with Dragons and Mother of Dragons), and add meta-game features (abuse reports, ranked games, ...).
                </p>
